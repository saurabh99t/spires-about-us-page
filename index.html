    <p>If you're a student seeking job opportunities, it's crucial to navigate the job market with caution and awareness. Fraudsters often target enthusiastic job seekers like you. Follow these guidelines to ensure a safe and successful job search experience:</p>

    <h2>Common Job Scams to Watch Out For:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Job Offer Without an Interview:</strong> Legitimate employers usually interview candidates before offering a position.</li>
      <li><strong>Requests for Personal or Financial Information:</strong> Be cautious when sharing sensitive information online or over the phone, especially before verifying the legitimacy of the employer.</li>
      <li><strong>Work-from-Home Scams:</strong> Scammers might promise easy money by offering remote jobs that sound too good to be true.</li>
      <li><strong>Overpayment Scams:</strong> Be wary of employers who send you a check for an amount larger than agreed upon, asking you to refund the excess.</li>
      <li><strong>Fake Job Postings:</strong> Fraudsters might create fake job listings to collect personal information or even upfront fees.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preventive Measures:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Research the Company:</strong> Always research the company before applying or sharing any information. Visit their official website and check for legitimate contact information.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Sharing Sensitive Information:</strong> Be cautious when providing personal, financial, or identification information. Legitimate employers won't ask for such information upfront.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Reputable Job Portals:</strong> Stick to well-known job search websites that verify job postings. Scammers may use lesser-known platforms to target students.</li>
      <li><strong>Interview First:</strong> Be skeptical of job offers that don't involve an interview process. Legitimate employers want to get to know you before hiring.</li>
      <li><strong>Trust Your Instincts:</strong> If a job offer seems too good to be true or feels suspicious, trust your gut and investigate further. Don't rush into any decision.</li>
    </ul>
